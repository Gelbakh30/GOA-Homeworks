    <h1><b><i>Unated states war on japan</i></b></h1>

    <!-- we start talking about the theme -->
    <p>After devastating casualties by each other during World War II, the United States and Japan were able to
        establish a strong post-war diplomatic alliance. The U.S. State Department still refers to the American-Japanese
        relationship as "the cornerstone of the United States security interests in Asia and... fundamentally for
        regional stability and prosperity."

        <br>
        The Pacific half of World War II, which began with the Japanese attack on American naval base Pearl-HarHawaii,
        on December 7, 1941, ended almost four years after Japan surrendered to the U.S.-led Allies on 2 September 1945.
        The surrender came after <b>the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan<b />. Japan lost 3 million
            people in the
            war.
